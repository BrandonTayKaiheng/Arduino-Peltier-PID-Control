# Arduino-PID-Temperature-for-Peltier

The classic Proportional-Integral_Differential (PID) Controller implemented digitally using an Arduino Uno microcontroller to regulate the temperature of a Peltier thermoelectric device. Here, I tried to get the Peltier device to maintain its temperature of 12 degree Celsius regardless of changing ambient temperature. The temperature response can be monitored using the Serial Monitor, or Data Streamer on Microsoft Excel. Electrical wiring schematic is included.
